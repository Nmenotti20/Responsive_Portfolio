### 1. Project Description Objective

The objective of this project was to use Bootstrap to create a responsive portfolio website that includes a navbar, responsive layout, responsive images, and that minimizes the use of media queries. The portfolio is now updated with a link to a current resume, my personal LinedIn Profile, along with some sample images of my recent portfolio of highlighted projects and a link to my GitHub page where you can find the repos and check out my code.

The minimum requirements for this project were to have a functional, deployed application, along with a GitHub repository with a README (this is it) describing the project. The navbar must be consistent on each page with working links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages. Semantic HTML must be used and all HTML must be correct and validated using a service. Each page must contain personalized information including a biography, name, images, links to social media, etc. Bootstrap components must be used properly along with the Bootstrap grid system.
